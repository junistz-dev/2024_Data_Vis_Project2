        <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a significant contributor to global warming and climate change. 
          The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes are some of the primary sources of CO2 emissions. 
          Understanding the trends and patterns of CO2 emissions is essential for addressing climate change and developing sustainable solutions. 
          This page explores the annual CO2 emissions worldwide, per capita emissions, and the historical contributions of different regions to global emissions.</p>

        <h2>Per capita CO₂ emissions, 2022</h2>
        <p> There are significant disparities in per capita CO2 emissions worldwide. The highest per capita emissions are found in major oil-producing countries, particularly in the Middle East, such as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kuwait. However, many of these countries have small populations, leading to lower total annual emissions.

          In contrast, populous countries like the United States, Australia, and Canada have per capita emissions that are about three times the global average. This trend is expected, as there is a strong correlation between per capita CO2 emissions and income; wealthier nations typically have higher carbon footprints. Nevertheless, substantial differences in emissions can exist even among countries with similar living standards. For example, many European countries have significantly lower emissions than the United States, Canada, or Australia. </p>

        <h2>How have global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)<br> changed over time?</h2>
        <p>Global emissions have surged significantly since the mid-18th century, with minimal levels before the Industrial Revolution. 
           The rise was gradual until around 1950, when CO2 emissions hit 6 billion tonnes. By 1990, this had nearly quadrupled to over 20 billion tonnes. 
           Emissions have since continued their rapid climb, surpassing 35 billion tonnes annually. While the pace of growth has slowed in recent years, emissions are still rising and have not yet peaked.</p>

        <h2> Annual change in CO2 emissions by Countries / Regions</h2>
        <p>This chart illustrates the year-on-year growth rate of CO2 emissions.
           A positive percentage signifies that emissions in a given year exceeded those of the previous year, while a negative percentage indicates they fell compared to the year before. 
           For instance, if the change is +1.5%, it means global emissions were up by 1.5% compared to the prior year; conversely, a change of -1.5% means emissions decreased by 1.5%.
            This metric enables us to identify both the regions where emissions are increasing and where they are decreasing. 
            Additionally, it provides insights into the pace of change in emissions, revealing whether the growth rate is accelerating or decelerating.</p>

        <h2>How has each region’s share of global cumulative CO2 emissions<br> changed over time?</h2> 
        <p>From 1751 to 1950, Europe contributed more than half of global cumulative CO2 emissions, with the UK dominating until 1882. 
          Industrialization in the USA then significantly increased its share throughout the next century.
           In the last 50 years, South America, Asia, and Africa have seen their contributions grow.</p>
