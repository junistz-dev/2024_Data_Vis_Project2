        <h3>This website explores the topic of water usage, production, and waste in Malaysia, focusing on water consumption patterns for domestic and non-domestic purposes by state. It also examines how water consumption in Malaysian states has changed over time, along with an analysis of Malaysiaâ€™s water production and the production levels by state. Through these insights, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the future outlook for water usage in Malaysia, as well as the challenges related to production and waste management.</h3>
        
        <h2>Malaysia Water Consumption for Domestic/Non-Domestic Purpose by State</h2>
        <h2>How have water consumption of States in Malaysia changed over time?</h2>
        <h3>In this chart, we see that Malaysia's water consumption for purposes has evolved significantly from 2003 to 2022. For instance, in 2003, the overall domestic water consumption was relatively low, but as the population grew and urbanization increased, we observed a steady rise in water usage. By 2010, domestic water consumption had increased substantially, reflecting a growing demand for household water supply. The trend continued, and by 2022, we see that water consumption per capita has reached new heights, emphasizing the importance of sustainable water management practices in addressing this growing demand.</h3>

        <h2>Malaysia Water Production</h2>
        <div id="map_chart_3" class="vis-container"></div>
        <h3>From 2000 to 2022, Malaysia's annual water production steadily increased, driven by population growth, industrial demands, and climate conditions. The government has invested in improving water management and infrastructure to ensure sustainable supply and quality. However, challenges such as water pollution and equitable access remain.</h3>
