        <h3>In Malaysia, water consumption varies by state and sector, with annual data showing a breakdown between domestic and non-domestic usage. As of December 31, 2022, the country has been actively monitoring water production across different states, which is essential for meeting the growing demand. Access to treated water is another critical factor, with annual statistics indicating how many households have access to treated piped water, segmented by state and housing strata. These aspects are vital for understanding the overall water management situation in Malaysia and identifying areas for improvement.</h3>
        
        <h2>Malaysia Water Consumption for Domestic/Non-Domestic Purpose by State</h2>
        <h2>How have water consumption of States in Malaysia changed over time?</h2>
        <h3>In this chart, we see that Malaysia's water consumption for purposes has evolved significantly from 2003 to 2022. For instance, in 2003, the overall domestic water consumption was relatively low, but as the population grew and urbanization increased, we observed a steady rise in water usage. By 2010, domestic water consumption had increased substantially, reflecting a growing demand for household water supply. The trend continued, and by 2022, we see that water consumption per capita has reached new heights, emphasizing the importance of sustainable water management practices in addressing this growing demand.</h3>

        <h2>Malaysia Water Production</h2>
        <div id="map_chart_3" class="vis-container"></div>
        <h3>From 2000 to 2022, Malaysia's annual water production steadily increased, driven by population growth, industrial demands, and climate conditions. The government has invested in improving water management and infrastructure to ensure sustainable supply and quality. However, challenges such as water pollution and equitable access remain.</h3>
