        <h2>Malaysia Water Consumption for Domestic/Non-Domestic Purpose by State</h2>
        <div id="map_chart_0" class="vis-container"></div>
        <h3>Malaysia's water consumption grew steadily from 2003 to 2022, driven by population growth and urbanization. By 2022, demand had peaked, stressing the need for sustainable water management.</h3>

        <h2>Malaysia Water Production</h2>
        <div id="map_chart_3" class="vis-container"></div>
        <h3>From 2000 to 2022, Malaysia's annual water production steadily increased, driven by population growth, industrial demands, and climate conditions. The government has invested in improving water management and infrastructure to ensure sustainable supply and quality. However, challenges such as water pollution and equitable access remain.</h3>

        <h2>Malaysia Water Production by State</h2>
        <div id="map_chart_4" class="vis-container"></div>
        <h3>Water production in Malaysia showed a general increase from 2000 to 2022. Notably, Selangor state exhibited a significant surge in water supply compared to other states. Sarawak also demonstrated a gradual increase, while Kedah experienced a considerable rise as well.</h3>

        <h2>Scatter Plot between Water Access and Water Production</h2>
        <div id="map_chart_5" class="vis-container"></div>
        <h3> Overall data indicates that most main states in Malaysia had water access percentages close to 100% since 2000. Over time, water production has increased. The most notable trend is the rise in water production alongside the increase in access in Kelantan. Additionally, both Sabah and Sarawak exhibit similar patterns of growth in water production.</h3>
